# Stable-Diffusion-Anomaly-Detection

Visual anomaly detection is essential for industrial quality inspection and medical diagnosis. Previous research in this field has focused on training custom models for each specific task, which requires thousands of images and annotation. In this work, we depart from this approach, drawing inspiration from reconstruction-based meth-odologies and leveraging the remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities of foundation models. We propose a novel framework, Stable Diffusion Anomaly De-tection (SDAD), which operates by reconstructing target images using pre-trained diffusion models and employs Segment Anything to enhance the adaptability of modern foundation models to anomaly detection. In VisA dataset, SDAD achieves pixel level state-of-the-art results in zero-shot visual anomaly detection without fur-ther tuning. This highlights the effectiveness of our framework in achieving superior anomaly detection performance without the task-specific constraints of traditional approaches.
